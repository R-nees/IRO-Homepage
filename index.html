            <p>It will only take you a few minutes to create a profile so others can find you, and you can start your own search for massage partners. A free membership allows you to create a profile, search for massage partners, and receive messages.</p>
            <p>With an upgrade to one of our paid memberships, you can be proactive in reaching out to other members. Our most popular upgrade option costs no more than a typical 90-minute massage session, and there is no limit to the number of partners you can connect with.</p>
